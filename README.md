## Overview

This chalange consist in a NFT card, where contains the art and basic information like description and artist name.

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided.

obs: in this particular task i don't have access to figma, so you may see some minor diferences.

## My process

First, I draw a scheme using the provide material, to identify the divs and corelate them. Then, transcripted the initial structure to HTML with the classes to each element (but during the coding I had to revise some classes and add others), next i declared the variables and reset some parameters in css, so i could start to proprely stylize the card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Perfect pixel (because i don't had the access to Figma)

### What I learned

In this particular project i have some trouble to properly define the hover status at the art, but it was a good oportunity to consult the Dev Quest comunity to find the right path.
